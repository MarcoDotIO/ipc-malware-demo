## Disclaimer
This code contains malicious code that is explicitly labeled as such within the source file. Run this package at your own risk, as I do not take responsibility for any damages caused by the use of this package. This is here as an unobfuscated archive of the original malware written by [Brandon Nozaki Miller](https://github.com/RIAEvangelist). The code here serves as a full write up explanation of how the code within the script works, as well with explaining the needed topics to understand some of the functionality for the script. I have provided all of the relevant links within the code to reference back to.

As well, please do not go and harass, threaten, and/or harm Brandon for this malware; as the best action to take is to hold him accountable for his actions.
